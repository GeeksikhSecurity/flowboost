# DBT Skills Integration in FlowBoost AI

FlowBoost AI incorporates principles from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) in a simple, accessible way. These skills help users manage emotions, stay focused, and build productive habits.

## Core Skills Integration

### Mindfulness

**How it's implemented:**
- Focus timer encourages present-moment awareness
- Task completion celebrations promote mindful acknowledgment of achievements
- Break reminders help users check in with themselves

**Sample prompt:**
```
Notice how you're feeling right now. Are you tense or relaxed? Take three slow breaths before starting your next task. This small pause helps reset your attention.
```

### Distress Tolerance

**How it's implemented:**
- Breaking tasks into micro-steps reduces overwhelm
- Encouraging messages when tasks feel difficult
- Adaptive timer adjusts to user needs

**Sample prompt:**
```
This task seems challenging for you. Remember that discomfort is temporary. Try working on it for just 5 minutes, then decide if you want to continue or switch to something else.
```

### Emotion Regulation

**How it's implemented:**
- Reflection prompts help identify emotional patterns
- Celebration messages reinforce positive emotions
- AI suggestions for reframing negative thoughts

**Sample prompt:**
```
I notice you've deleted and restarted this task several times. Perfectionism might be creating frustration. What would "good enough" look like for this task right now?
```

### Interpersonal Effectiveness

**How it's implemented:**
- Clear, direct communication style in all app messages
- Feedback collection that validates user experiences
- Non-judgmental tone throughout the experience

**Sample prompt:**
```
Setting boundaries helps protect your focus time. Consider letting others know you'll be unavailable during your next focus session. Being clear about your needs helps everyone.
```
